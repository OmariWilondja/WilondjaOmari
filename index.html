          <p style="color:black"> <b>In my spare time, I am always listening to or creating music. I am a big fan of Congolese music known as "La rumba Congolaise." I listen to this type of music on my walk to class or whenever I need to distract myself from daily life problems. I also enjoy playing and watching football. I am a die-hard Arsenal supporter, a Premier League football team headquartered in London, United Kingdom.</b> </p>
