			  <h3>Life in Kigoma, Tanzania</h3>
			  <p style="color:black"> Kigoma is a city in Tanzania, East Africa, located on the northeastern shores of Lake Tanganyika and near the borders with Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I was born and raised in Kigoma. I didn't get to discover the beautiful things the city had to offer because I was mainly in the refugee camp.</p>

    <p style="color:black"> However, I have vivid memories of engaging with a Kigoma-based ethnic tribe known as the Waha. I also recall eating Mikebuka, one of the tastiest fish in the world that can only be found in Lake Tanganyika.</p>

  	       <<h3>From Kigoma to Wisconsin</h3>
			  <p style="color:black"> My family and I got the opportunity to pursue a better life in the United States in 2016. When I discovered that Wisconsin had been assigned to us as a state. I spent almost an hour comparing Tanzania and Wisconsin maps. In other words, I assumed we'd been assigned to Tanzania again.</p>

    <p style="color:black"> I came to Wisconsin during the winter and had numerous challenges, including learning English and adapting to the American educational system.</p>
